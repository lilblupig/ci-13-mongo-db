# **Python and Mongo DB**

# Overview
Manipulate a non-relational database using Python, first in the terminal directly, and then by creating a small terminal based front end application.

## Technologies Used

### **Languages**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) is the primary programming language used to build the project.

### **Libraries and Frameworks**
* [pymongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/pymongo/) is the official Python driver for MongoDB.

### **Tools**
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) was used to store the database.
* [mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/mongo/) was used to interact with MongoDb from the CLI.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/) were used for version control and repository storage.
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the IDE used to write the project.
* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) were used for specific responsiveness testing and drilling down into bug fixing.


## **Resources**
* [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used to set up the repository.
